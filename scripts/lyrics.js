Give your dad a call.<br>Say we just got in, and we’re much too tired to talk.<br><br>We’ve lived alarmingly since the outset,<br>explored the attic space like Jacques Marquette.<br>I’d gladly walk the cable wire without a safety net.<br><br>And it’s a shame there’s nothing left to find<br>that hasn’t been exposed and posed a thousand times.`
